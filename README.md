# VBA-Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street

Using data provided from the Stock market, the challenge was to:
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
    The ticker symbol.
    Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.     
    The % change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    The total stock volume of the stock.
Use conditional formatting that to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
The solution should return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
Ensure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
